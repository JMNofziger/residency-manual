## Corrections applied

1. **`permit-admin-fee`:** €46.45 → **€74.32**; source retargeted to MUP Work of TCN; label clarifies stay-and-work (not generic temporary stay).
2. Biometric fee sources retargeted to Work of TCN (same amounts).
3. Accelerated biometric production (€59.73) remains omitted from wizard defaults.
4. Biometrics **attendance** stays Step 7; fee amounts may appear on Step 6 with “pay when MUP instructs / at collection” copy.

## Intentional non-goals

- No invented national appointment-booking URL
